                <h3>Nothing that anyone says could describe Octavia E. Butler better than her own words, but let's sing
                    her praises anyway: a phenomenal writer, a true storyteller, a poetic wordsmith, a futuristic
                    visionary, a joy to read, and a genius. Don't go another day without consuming her words. Sadly, she
                    did not become an 80-year-old writer as she expected, but through her writing, she will always live
                    on...here and among the stars.</h3>
                <h3 id="her-description">"I'm a 48-year-old writer who can remember being a 10-year-old writer and who
                    expects someday to be an 80-year-old writer. I'm also comfortably asocial -- a hermit in the middle
                    of Los Angeles -- a pessimist if I'm not careful, a feminist, a Black, a former Baptist, an
                    oil-and-water combination of ambition, laziness, insecurity, certainty, and drive." ~~Octavia E.
